The present analysis utilizes the Readmissions and Deaths - Hospital dataset, which contains data on hospital readmission and mortality rates in the United States.
This dataset provides information on various hospitals, including location, performance measures for specific treatments, and comparisons with the national average.

The objective of this project is to analyze hospital readmission and mortality rates, identifying patterns and factors that may influence these indicators. 
Key questions explored include: Are there significant differences in service quality across different states? 
Do mortality and readmission rates vary based on hospital type or specialty? Can hospitals with better or worse performance be identified based on specific characteristics?

To answer these questions, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations. Graphs will be used to represent data distributions and compare hospitals and regions. Additionally, missing values will be identified and assessed for their impact on the analysis.
